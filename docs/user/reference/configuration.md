# Configuration Reference — Fast-Profile Policy Options

This page is the reference for every configuration option introduced in
Milestone 0005 for the fast-profile rules DS104–DS118. All defaults and
valid values on this page were verified against
`src/docsentinel/config.py` before publication.

For the standard-profile statistical keys (`max_grade_level`,
`duplicate_similarity`, `min_information_score`, `docsig_paths`,
`min_document_words`, `min_paragraph_words`, `min_paragraph_chars`),
see [Statistical Checks](statistical-checks.md).

## How to set options

Options are set in the same places as all other DocSentinel keys:

1. A `Config` object passed directly to `scan()` in the Python API (bypasses
   `load_config` validation; the caller is responsible for valid values).
2. `docsentinel.toml` at the scan root (keys at the top level — no table
   header). `doc_sentinel.toml` is accepted as an equivalent alias.
3. `[tool.doc_sentinel]` in `pyproject.toml` at the scan root.

When a standalone file (`docsentinel.toml` or `doc_sentinel.toml`) and
`pyproject.toml` both exist, the standalone file wins and `pyproject.toml` is
ignored. Having both `docsentinel.toml` and `doc_sentinel.toml` in the same
root is ambiguous: the load fails with exit code 2 and names both files, so
keep only one. New projects should use `docsentinel.toml`, which is what
`docsentinel init` creates (it refuses to run next to an existing
`doc_sentinel.toml`). All options are validated on every
config load regardless of the active profile; an invalid value makes even a
fast scan fail with exit code 2.

For a working annotated example of every option in this page, see
[examples/docsentinel.toml](/examples/docsentinel.toml).

## Anchor options (DS104)

`DS104` reports conflicts between heading-derived slugs and explicit HTML
anchors. It is always active in the fast profile.

### `anchor_collision_policy`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string enum |
| Default | `"explicit"` |
| Valid values | `"off"`, `"explicit"` |
| Consumed by | DS104 |

Controls which kind of anchor collision DS104 reports.

- `"explicit"` (default): report every explicit `<a id="...">` or
  `<a name="...">` anchor whose id duplicates another anchor (generated or
  explicit) in the same document.
- `"off"`: DS104 emits nothing regardless of configuration. The rule still
  appears in `enabled_rules`; selection is orthogonal.

```toml
anchor_collision_policy = "explicit"
```

### `anchor_renderer`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string enum |
| Default | `"github"` |
| Valid values | `"github"` |
| Consumed by | DS104 |

Heading-slug algorithm DS104 uses when checking whether a generated heading
anchor collides with an explicit anchor. Currently only GitHub-style slugging
(`"github"`) is supported; the enum may be extended in a future milestone.

```toml
anchor_renderer = "github"
```

---

## Heading options (DS105)

`DS105` reports heading-level skips and violations of the configured first
heading level. It is always active in the fast profile.

### `heading_level_policy`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string enum |
| Default | `"no-skips"` |
| Valid values | `"off"`, `"no-skips"` |
| Consumed by | DS105 |

- `"no-skips"` (default): report any heading that jumps more than one level
  down from the previous heading (for example `## H2` directly followed by
  `#### H4`). A level-1 heading is the expected first heading by default
  (controlled by `first_heading_level`).
- `"off"`: DS105 emits nothing.

```toml
heading_level_policy = "no-skips"
```

### `first_heading_level`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | integer |
| Default | `1` |
| Valid values | integer 1–6 |
| Consumed by | DS105 |

The heading level expected to appear first in a document. When a document's
first heading is at a different level DS105 reports it. The default `1`
means every document should open with an `# H1`.

```toml
first_heading_level = 1
```

**Validation error** — not an integer, or outside 1–6:
```
first_heading_level must be an integer >= 1
```

### `multiple_h1_policy`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string enum |
| Default | `"allow"` |
| Valid values | `"allow"`, `"warn"` |
| Consumed by | DS105 |

- `"allow"` (default): more than one level-1 heading in a document is
  accepted.
- `"warn"`: DS105 reports each H1 after the first.

```toml
multiple_h1_policy = "warn"
```

### `setext_heading_support`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `true` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS105 |

Whether setext-style headings (a line underlined with `===` or `---`) count
as headings for DS105's hierarchy check.

```toml
setext_heading_support = true
```

---

## Section options (DS106)

`DS106` reports empty or contentless leaf sections. It is always active in
the fast profile.

### `empty_section_policy`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string enum |
| Default | `"leaf"` |
| Valid values | `"off"`, `"leaf"`, `"all"` |
| Consumed by | DS106 |

- `"leaf"` (default): report only leaf sections (a heading whose body
  contains no sub-heading) with no visible content.
- `"all"`: report all sections, including non-leaf ones, whose body has no
  visible content before the first sub-heading.
- `"off"`: DS106 emits nothing.

```toml
empty_section_policy = "leaf"
```

### `placeholder_content_policy`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string enum |
| Default | `"ignore"` |
| Valid values | `"ignore"`, `"count"` |
| Consumed by | DS106 |

Whether HTML comments (such as a comment containing a placeholder note) count
as section content. Example of a comment-only section body:

```markdown
## In Progress

<!-- This section will be filled in once the API stabilises. -->
```

- `"ignore"` (default): HTML comments are stripped before DS106 tests for
  emptiness, so a section with only a comment is considered empty.
- `"count"`: HTML comments count as visible content; a section is not empty
  if it contains one.

Note: visible marker words like `TODO` or `FIXME` in prose are **always**
treated as content by DS106. DS119 (not yet implemented) is the rule for
detecting leftover TODO markers.

```toml
placeholder_content_policy = "ignore"
```

### `image_content_counts`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `true` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS106 |

Whether an image (`![alt](src)`) counts as section content. When `true` (the
default), a section that contains only an image is not reported as empty.

```toml
image_content_counts = true
```

### `empty_section_min_text_chars`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | integer |
| Default | `0` |
| Valid values | integer >= 0 |
| Consumed by | DS106 |

Visible-character threshold. A section is reported when its visible
non-whitespace character count is **less than or equal to** this value, so
a section must carry **strictly more** than `empty_section_min_text_chars`
characters to be non-empty. The default `0` means any visible text at all
is enough to pass.

Setting a positive value (e.g. `5`) flags sections with very short bodies.
This overlaps with DS203 quality scoring; prefer DS203's `min_information_score`
for quality filtering.

```toml
empty_section_min_text_chars = 0
```

**Validation error** — negative integer:
```
empty_section_min_text_chars must be a non-negative integer
```

---

## Reference definition options (DS108)

`DS108` reports reference-style link definition integrity problems. It is
always active in the fast profile.

### `unused_reference_definitions`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `false` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS108 |

Whether DS108 flags reference definitions that are never used in the same
document. Off by default because many repositories intentionally define
shared or reusable references.

```toml
unused_reference_definitions = false
```

### `duplicate_reference_definitions`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string enum |
| Default | `"warn"` |
| Valid values | `"off"`, `"warn"`, `"error"` |
| Consumed by | DS108 |

Severity for a reference label defined more than once in the same document.

- `"off"`: duplicates are not reported.
- `"warn"` (default): duplicates produce a warning finding.
- `"error"`: duplicates produce an error finding (blocking by default, or
  under `--strict`).

```toml
duplicate_reference_definitions = "warn"
```

### `reference_label_normalization`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string enum |
| Default | `"commonmark"` |
| Valid values | `"commonmark"` |
| Consumed by | DS108 |

The normalization dialect used to compare reference labels. `"commonmark"`
applies Unicode NFC normalization, whitespace collapse, and Unicode case
folding, so `[Getting Started]` and `[getting   started]` are the same
label. Only `"commonmark"` is currently supported; any other value is
rejected on load.

```toml
reference_label_normalization = "commonmark"
```

---

## Fence options (DS109)

`DS109` reports malformed or unclosed fenced code blocks. It is always
active in the fast profile at error severity.

### `fence_dialect`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string enum |
| Default | `"gfm-subset"` |
| Valid values | `"gfm-subset"` |
| Consumed by | DS109, DS110 |

The fenced-code dialect recognized. `"gfm-subset"` (the only supported
value) accepts backtick and tilde fences with 1–3 leading spaces; a closing
fence must use the same marker character and equal or longer run, with an
empty info string. Indented (4-space) code blocks are not recognized.

```toml
fence_dialect = "gfm-subset"
```

### `report_stray_closing_fence`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `false` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS109 |

Reserved. In the `gfm-subset` dialect a stray closing fence (a closing
marker with no preceding opening fence) is silently ignored. This option is
accepted but currently has no effect; it is a placeholder for a future
dialect that may report orphan closers.

```toml
report_stray_closing_fence = false
```

---

## Fence language options (DS110) — opt-in

`DS110` is an **opt-in** rule: it is silent until `require_fence_languages`
is set to `true`. It is always in `enabled_rules` and named in the scan
notice when off.

### `require_fence_languages`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `false` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS110 (opt-in gate) |

The opt-in switch for DS110. When `true`, every non-empty fenced code block
must carry a language label. Empty fences are controlled by
`allow_unlabelled_empty_fences`.

```toml
require_fence_languages = true
```

### `allow_unlabelled_empty_fences`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `true` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS110 |

When `true` (the default), empty fences (fences with no content lines) are
exempt from the language-label requirement even when
`require_fence_languages` is enabled.

```toml
allow_unlabelled_empty_fences = true
```

### `allowed_fence_languages`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | list of strings |
| Default | `[]` (all languages allowed) |
| Valid values | list of non-empty single-token strings |
| Consumed by | DS110 |

Allowlist of accepted language labels. When empty (the default), any label
satisfies the requirement. When non-empty, only the listed labels are
accepted; a fence with a different label is reported.

Labels are matched case-sensitively. An entry containing whitespace is
rejected with a `ConfigError` because it can never match a single-token
language.

```toml
allowed_fence_languages = ["python", "bash", "yaml", "toml", "json"]
```

**Validation error** — whitespace in an entry:
```
allowed_fence_languages entries must be single tokens (no whitespace)
```

---

## Table options (DS117)

`DS117` reports malformed GFM pipe-table structure. It is always active in
the fast profile.

### `table_dialect`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string enum |
| Default | `"gfm-subset"` |
| Valid values | `"gfm-subset"` |
| Consumed by | DS117 |

The pipe-table dialect DS117 validates. `"gfm-subset"` is the only supported
value. Pipe tables inside block quotes, list items, or 4-space indented code
are not recognized. When `table_dialect` names an unsupported value DS117
emits nothing.

```toml
table_dialect = "gfm-subset"
```

**Known limitation:** GitHub splits table cells on every unescaped pipe,
even inside backtick code spans. DS117 instead protects pipes inside code
spans (they do not split a cell). DS117 can therefore under-report relative
to what GitHub renders. A literal pipe that must split a cell should be
written outside a code span or escaped as `\|`.

### `table_strict_cells`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `true` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS117 |

When `true` (the default), DS117 reports a body row whose logical cell count
differs from the header row. When `false`, cell-count mismatches are not
reported; only malformed alignment markers are.

```toml
table_strict_cells = true
```

### `table_enable`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `true` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS117 |

When `false`, DS117 performs no table scanning and emits nothing. Use this
to silence all table findings without removing DS117 from `enabled_rules`.

```toml
table_enable = true
```

---

## Navigation options (DS112) — opt-in

`DS112` is an **opt-in** rule: it is silent until `navigation_indexes` names
at least one index document. A missing or unreadable configured index is a
fail-closed readiness error (exit code 2), not a finding.

### `navigation_indexes`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | list of relative paths |
| Default | `[]` |
| Valid values | non-empty list of relative paths inside the scan root |
| Consumed by | DS112 (opt-in gate) |

Paths to Markdown index documents whose navigation lists are inspected. Each
path must be inside the scan root; paths that escape the root are rejected
on load with a `ConfigError`. Each configured index must be present in the
discovered document set (an in-root, non-symlinked, regular `.md` file
matching `include`/`exclude`); if it is not, DS112 raises a readiness
`ConfigError` (CLI exit 2).

```toml
navigation_indexes = ["docs/README.md"]
```

**Polyrepo note.** Navigation links are checked inside the scan root only;
cross-root links trigger DS116. In a polyrepo where docs reference sibling
repositories, consider setting `root_escape_policy = "warn"` or `"off"` to
avoid DS116 blocking the build.

### `navigation_required`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | list of relative paths |
| Default | `[]` |
| Valid values | list of relative paths inside the scan root |
| Consumed by | DS112 |

Documents that must appear in at least one navigation link across all
configured indexes. DS112 reports a `warning` for each required document
with no inbound navigation link.

```toml
navigation_required = ["docs/architecture/README.md", "docs/user/tutorial/README.md"]
```

### `navigation_unique_targets`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `true` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS112 |

When `true` (the default), DS112 reports a navigation link target that
appears more than once within the same index document.

```toml
navigation_unique_targets = true
```

### `navigation_check_missing`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `true` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS112 |

When `true` (the default), DS112 reports a navigation link whose local
destination does not exist on disk.

```toml
navigation_check_missing = true
```

---

## Asset options (DS113)

`DS113` reports local media and document assets that do not exist as a
regular file inside the scan root. It is always active in the fast profile
at error severity (blocking by default, downgraded by `missing_asset_policy`).

### `asset_extensions`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | list of strings |
| Default | `["png", "jpg", "jpeg", "svg", "webp", "gif", "pdf"]` |
| Valid values | list of non-empty extension strings (without leading `.`) |
| Consumed by | DS113 |

File extensions that DS113 treats as local media assets when encountered as
HTML `<a href>` link targets or reference-definition targets. The comparison
is case-insensitive. Markdown images (`![alt](src)`) and HTML `<img>`/`<source>`
tags are always checked regardless of extension; this option gates only
link-shaped references.

```toml
asset_extensions = ["png", "jpg", "jpeg", "svg", "webp", "gif", "pdf"]
```

### `check_html_asset_tags`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `true` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS113 |

When `true` (the default), DS113 inspects HTML `<img src>`, `<source src>`,
and `<a href>` tags for missing local assets.

```toml
check_html_asset_tags = true
```

### `check_markdown_images`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `true` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS113 |

When `true` (the default), DS113 inspects Markdown image syntax
`![alt](src)` for missing local assets.

```toml
check_markdown_images = true
```

### `check_srcset`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `true` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS113 |

When `true` (the default), DS113 inspects `srcset` attribute candidates
(from `<img srcset="...">` and `<source srcset="...">`) for missing local
assets. `srcset` values are split per the WHATWG algorithm.

```toml
check_srcset = true
```

### `missing_asset_policy`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string enum |
| Default | `"error"` |
| Valid values | `"off"`, `"warn"`, `"error"` |
| Consumed by | DS113 |

Severity policy for a missing or non-regular local asset, mirroring
`root_escape_policy`.

- `"off"`: DS113 emits nothing and performs no filesystem access.
- `"warn"`: each finding is downgraded to `warning` severity.
- `"error"` (default): each finding is `error` severity (blocking).

Teams whose documentation references generated or LFS-stored assets that are
not present at lint time should set this to `"warn"` to avoid blocking the build.

```toml
missing_asset_policy = "error"
```

---

## Path-boundary options (DS116)

`DS116` reports references that escape the documentation root. It is always
active in the fast profile at error severity.

### `root_escape_policy`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string enum |
| Default | `"error"` |
| Valid values | `"off"`, `"warn"`, `"error"` |
| Consumed by | DS116 |

Severity policy for a reference that escapes the scan root.

- `"off"`: DS116 emits nothing.
- `"warn"`: each finding is `warning` severity.
- `"error"` (default): each finding is `error` severity (blocking).

**Polyrepo docs.** In a polyrepo where Markdown documents legitimately
reference sibling repositories with relative `../sibling/README.md` paths,
every such link escapes the single-repository scan root and would be flagged
at error severity. Set `root_escape_policy = "warn"` or `"off"` for repos
that intentionally cross root boundaries, or scope the scan to a subdirectory
that keeps all cross-links inside the root.

```toml
root_escape_policy = "error"
```

### `decode_percent_paths`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `true` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS116 |

When `true` (the default), DS116 percent-decodes link targets once before
checking for root escape, so `..%2f..%2fpasswd` is treated as a traversal.
Double-encoded paths (`%252e%252e`) are not decoded.

```toml
decode_percent_paths = true
```

### `windows_path_policy`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string enum |
| Default | `"portable"` |
| Valid values | `"off"`, `"portable"` |
| Consumed by | DS116 |

How DS116 treats Windows-style drive letters (`C:\`), UNC paths
(`\\server\share`), and rooted backslash paths.

- `"portable"` (default): drive letters, UNC prefixes, and backslash
  separators in links, images, reference definitions, and HTML
  `href`/`src`/`srcset` are reported as unsafe. In inline code spans they
  are treated as documentation and not reported (DS103 retains its legacy
  behaviour for those).
- `"off"`: Windows path forms are not reported. Use only when all consumers
  are Windows and portability is not a concern.

```toml
windows_path_policy = "portable"
```

---

## Document identity options (DS114)

`DS114` reports duplicate stable document identifiers across the corpus.
It is always active in the fast profile at error severity.

### `document_id_field`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string |
| Default | `"id"` |
| Valid values | alphanumeric/underscore/hyphen identifier, 1–128 characters |
| Consumed by | DS114 |

The YAML frontmatter key whose value DS114 uses as the document's stable
identity. The default `"id"` means DS114 looks for `id:` in the opening
`---` block.

```toml
document_id_field = "id"
```

**Validation error** — wrong characters or empty:
```
document_id_field must match [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_-]{0,127}
```

### `document_id_scope`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string enum |
| Default | `"corpus"` |
| Valid values | `"corpus"`, `"directory"` |
| Consumed by | DS114 |

Scope within which document identities must be unique.

- `"corpus"` (default): ids must be unique across all discovered documents.
- `"directory"`: ids must be unique within each directory (the parent
  directory of each document).

```toml
document_id_scope = "corpus"
```

### `document_id_case_sensitive`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `true` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS114 |

When `true` (the default), identity comparison is case-sensitive: `Guide`
and `guide` are distinct identities. When `false`, identities are
case-folded before comparison.

```toml
document_id_case_sensitive = true
```

### `document_id_required`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `false` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS114 |

When `true`, every discovered document must declare an identity in its
frontmatter (the configured `document_id_field` must be present with a
non-null value). Documents that do not are reported as findings.

```toml
document_id_required = false
```

---

## Deprecated reference options (DS115) — opt-in

`DS115` is an **opt-in** rule: it is silent until
`deprecated_references_file` names a TOML mapping file. A missing,
unreadable, or schema-invalid mapping is a fail-closed readiness error
(exit code 2), not a finding.

### `deprecated_references_file`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string (relative path) |
| Default | `""` (empty, rule is off) |
| Valid values | relative path inside the scan root |
| Consumed by | DS115 (opt-in gate) |

Path to a TOML file mapping deprecated names to their replacements. The
file must be inside the scan root. Example mapping file:

```toml
version = 1

[[replacement]]
old = "oldmod"
new = "newmod"
kind = "prose"           # prose | link | identifier

[[replacement]]
old = "docs/old-guide.md"
new = "docs/new-guide.md"
kind = "link"
scope = ["!archive/*"]   # exempt paths matching archive/*
```

```toml
deprecated_references_file = ".deprecated-names.toml"
```

### `deprecated_check_prose`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `true` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS115 |

When `true` (the default), DS115 checks `kind = "prose"` and
`kind = "identifier"` entries against prose text and inline code spans
respectively.

```toml
deprecated_check_prose = true
```

### `deprecated_check_links`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `true` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS115 |

When `true` (the default), DS115 checks `kind = "link"` entries against
local link targets and reference-definition targets (lexically only —
existence is DS101's concern).

```toml
deprecated_check_links = true
```

### `deprecated_case_sensitive`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `true` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS115 |

When `true` (the default), deprecated term matching is case-sensitive. When
`false`, both the `old` token and the document text are NFC case-folded
before comparison.

```toml
deprecated_case_sensitive = true
```

---

## Documentation naming options (DS118) — opt-in

`DS118` is an **opt-in** rule: it is silent until `documentation_naming`
selects a style. It reads no document content and touches no filesystem; it
decides entirely from each discovered document's relative path string.

### `documentation_naming`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | string enum |
| Default | `"off"` |
| Valid values | `"off"`, `"kebab"`, `"snake"` |
| Consumed by | DS118 (opt-in gate) |

The naming style enforced on every discovered document path component.

- `"off"` (default): DS118 emits nothing.
- `"kebab"`: each path component must be lowercase ASCII
  alphanumeric words joined by single hyphens (`lowercase-words.md`).
- `"snake"`: each path component must be lowercase ASCII
  alphanumeric words joined by single underscores (`lowercase_words.md`).

Non-ASCII characters are not allowed under either style (the policy is
deliberately portable-ASCII). DS118 suggests a deterministic conformant
rename for each violation.

```toml
documentation_naming = "kebab"
```

### `documentation_naming_allow`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | list of strings |
| Default | `["README.md", "index.md"]` |
| Valid values | list of non-empty strings |
| Consumed by | DS118 |

Exact filename exemptions. A path's filename (the final component) is exempt
when it matches exactly. A full relative path is exempt when the whole path
matches. Comparison is case-sensitive.

```toml
documentation_naming_allow = ["README.md", "index.md", "CHANGELOG.md"]
```

### `documentation_naming_directories`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | boolean |
| Default | `true` |
| Valid values | `true`, `false` |
| Consumed by | DS118 |

When `true` (the default), DS118 checks directory components of each
discovered document path in addition to the file component. When `false`,
only the file component is checked.

```toml
documentation_naming_directories = true
```

### `documentation_naming_prefix_patterns`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | list of strings |
| Default | `[]` |
| Valid values | list of restricted glob-subset strings |
| Consumed by | DS118 |

Glob-subset patterns for conventional numeric prefixes such as ADR numbers
(`0001-`) or version tags (`v1-`). A literal character matches itself; `?`
matches exactly one character; `*` matches any (possibly empty) run. No
character classes, alternations, or anchors; the text is never compiled as a
regular expression.

A path component is exempt from the style check only for the prefix portion
matching the pattern; the remainder still must conform.

```toml
documentation_naming_prefix_patterns = ["[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-", "v*-"]
```

**Validation error** — too many patterns or a pattern that is too long:
```
documentation_naming_prefix_patterns: too many patterns (max 256)
documentation_naming_prefix_patterns: pattern too long (max 256 chars)
```
