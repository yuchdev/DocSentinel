"""Reporter control-character neutralisation (Story 15.0 Task 02 A).

These tests pin the tool-wide hardening that neutralises ANSI escapes, C0/C1
controls, DEL, bidirectional overrides and zero-width format characters before the
human-facing text and GitHub-annotation sinks render an untrusted path or message.
They also assert the two invariants the fix must not break: ASCII-printable input
renders byte-identically, and baseline fingerprints (hashed from the raw
:class:`~docsentinel.models.Finding` fields) are unaffected by the escaped output.
