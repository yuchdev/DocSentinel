"""Integration tests for DS114 over committed Markdown assets in ``tests/assets/ds114``.

This is Story 12.0 Task 03, the always-active duplicate-stable-document-identifier
rule. Every one of the 14 committed scenarios is loaded in isolation through the
``asset_case`` fixture and asserted against an explicit, checked-in expectation table
(:data:`SETUP`, :data:`CLEAN_CASES`, :data:`FINDING_EXPECTATIONS`, :data:`ERROR_CASE`
and :data:`ERROR_EXPECTATION`) transcribed from the Task 02 manifest, the
``fixture-matrix`` DS114 rows and the detector's stable message contract, never
derived from whatever the analyzer currently emits. The 12 ``default``-setup
scenarios are also executed by the generic Milestone 0005 catalog; the two
non-default scenarios (``casefold_ids_optin`` with ``document_id_case_sensitive=false``
and ``missing_ids_required`` with ``document_id_required=true``) carry their exact
config here. For every CLEAN/FINDING scenario the outcome is asserted through both the
pure ``document_ids.detect`` entry point and the shared ``scan`` engine: zero findings
for the seven CLEAN cases and the exact one-based line, offending path and message for
the six FINDING cases.

The lone ERROR row ``invalid_nested_metadata`` is special by ruling: an unsupported id
value shape is reported as exactly **one** explicit own ``error`` finding that names the
field only (never the raw value) and excludes the document from uniqueness, rather than
aborting the scan with a ``ConfigError`` (exit 2) -- the catalog's
``FINDING_SATISFIES_ERROR`` allowlist encodes this and this suite pins its line, path,
severity and message and asserts the document never participates in a collision.
Malformed/unterminated/over-long frontmatter and duplicate id keys stay silent (DS111
territory), proven by the ``duplicate_key_one_document`` CLEAN case.

DS114 is a ``fast``-profile always-active rule at ``error`` severity with no opt-in
marker, so a single collision makes the CLI exit 1 even without ``--strict``. The file
also exercises the four typed options (``document_id_field``, ``document_id_scope``,
``document_id_case_sensitive``, ``document_id_required``) through both
``doc_sentinel.toml`` and ``[tool.doc_sentinel]`` including invalid values; the
config-injection trust boundary (an injected invalid ``document_id_scope`` fails closed
with a ``ConfigError`` rather than degrading to ``corpus``); ``select``/``ignore``
(exact and the ``DS11``/``DS1``/``DS2`` prefixes); baseline round-trips;
determinism across repeated scans and independence from document discovery order;
text/json/github report stability and hostile-id output safety (ESC, newline,
``::error``, RTL, NUL and a 10,000-character id are bounded and ``repr``-escaped with no
absolute path leaked); CRLF and BOM line fidelity; an invalid-UTF-8 head contributing no
identity without crashing; an unreadable document surfacing rather than a false clean; a
symlinked Markdown file never inventoried; the bounded head read over a document far
larger than the head bound; the DS104-vs-DS114 namespace split (a body ``id=`` HTML
anchor or a heading is never a document identity); the fast stdlib-only import with no
network or content execution; the CLI exit paths and ``docsentinel rules``/``doctor``
surfacing; and the linear-time requirement on adversarial document and frontmatter floods
routed through ``detect`` end to end. The exhaustive algorithmic shape coverage lives in
``tests/unit/test_detectors_document_ids.py`` and the syscall-level containment proofs in
``tests/mock/test_detectors_document_ids_oracle.py``; this suite proves the committed
scenarios and the cross-module behaviour.

    [Integration] detectors document identity uniqueness ds114: verifies a giant frontmatter scales near-linearly.

    Scenario:
        Given a doubling series of single documents whose frontmatter has either one very long id value line
            or very many keys, written as real files
        When document_ids.detect routes each through the shared scaling helper
        Then zero findings are produced at every size and the scaling stays under the linear bound, proving
        the bounded head read makes one linear pass with no quadratic value or line handling.

    Boundaries:
        - Focus: detect() end-to-end single linear pass over the head (no tail rescans, no quadratic)
        - Fixtures/params: parametrized over the giant-line and many-keys floods; tmp_path

    On failure, first check:
        - Whether _find_key_colon, the comment strip, or the quote parser rescanned the value
        - That zero findings still hold at every size
