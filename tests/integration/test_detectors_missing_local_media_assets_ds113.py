"""Integration tests for DS113 over committed Markdown assets in ``tests/assets/ds113``.

This is Story 10.0 Task 03, the security-sensitive missing-local-asset rule. Every
one of the 15 committed scenarios is loaded in isolation through the ``asset_case``
fixture and asserted against an explicit, checked-in expectation table
(:data:`CLEAN_CASES`, :data:`FINDING_EXPECTATIONS`, :data:`EXPECTED_SIBLINGS`, the
exact-config :data:`PDF_CASE` and the runtime :data:`SYMLINK_CASE`) transcribed from
the Task 02 manifest, the fixture matrix and the detector's stable message contract,
never derived from whatever the analyzer currently emits. The 13 ``default``-setup
scenarios (8 CLEAN + 5 FINDING) are asserted through both the pure ``assets.detect``
entry point and the shared ``scan`` engine; ``missing_pdf_attachment`` is asserted
with its explicit ``asset_extensions=["pdf"]`` config and ``asset_symlink_outside``
builds its in-root symlink to a sibling out-of-root target at runtime in ``tmp_path``.

DS113 is an always-active ``fast`` rule at ``error`` severity with no opt-in marker,
so a single finding makes the CLI exit 1 even without ``--strict`` while the
``missing_asset_policy=warn`` downgrade keeps it to exit 0 (and 1 under ``--strict``);
all three are asserted. Coverage follows the standing threat model
(``docs/security/threat-model-ds113-missing-assets-2026-10-23.md``): escaping and
in-root-symlink-out references are DS116's alone and are never ``stat``-ed by DS113
(proven with a filesystem recorder); a missing in-root Markdown image is the
documented DS101 + DS113 overlap with no triple reporting; a committed FIFO or a
directory at an asset path is reported as "not a regular file" without ever being
opened (the FIFO test runs ``detect`` in a worker thread with a hard join timeout so a
regression that opens the pipe cannot hang the suite); a ``data:`` URI ``srcset``
candidate never manufactures a filesystem probe of its base64 fragment; and the
echoed target is bounded and ``repr``-escaped so no control byte or resolved absolute
path reaches a report sink.

The file also exercises the ``missing_asset_policy`` off/warn/error ladder (``off``
performing no ``stat``, proven with the recorder) through both ``doc_sentinel.toml``
and ``[tool.doc_sentinel]``; the ``check_html_asset_tags``/``check_markdown_images``/
``check_srcset`` toggles; case-insensitive extension matching; select/ignore (exact
and prefix); baseline round-trips; text/json/github report stability; the CLI exit
paths; ``docsentinel rules``/``doctor`` surfacing; invalid-config rejection; the edge
dimensions required by the task (CRLF line fidelity, invalid UTF-8, an unreadable
file); determinism across repeated and fresh roots; the fast stdlib-only import with
no network or content execution; and the linear-time requirement on adversarial image
and ``srcset`` floods routed through ``detect`` end to end over non-fenced prose. The
exhaustive algorithmic shape coverage for the shared scanner belongs to the unit
layer; this suite proves only that real files route through ``check_text`` with exact
deterministic counts and no super-linear blow-up over the file path. A markdown-it-py
differential over the image/srcset/href fixtures is kept as a scratch oracle (never a
runtime dependency) and is not duplicated here.

    Scenario:
        Given large, non-fenced Markdown of one representative shape - one giant line of distinct missing
            images, many single-image lines, or one ``srcset`` with many distinct missing candidates
        When assets.detect routes a doubling input series through the shared scaling helper
        Then every scale produces the exact deterministic finding count (so the pass is never vacuous) and
            the scaling stays under the shared linear bound, proving the per-reference stat is memoised and
            the shared scanner never rescans a line tail per bracket.

    Boundaries:
        - Focus: detect() routing of real files through check_text with bounded time (threat model MEDIUM DoS)
        - Non-goal: the exhaustive algorithmic shapes, which live in the shared-scanner unit tests
        - Fixtures/params: parametrized over the representative flood shapes; tmp_path

    On failure, first check:
        - Any accidentally quadratic rescan or a stat that is no longer memoised per distinct path
        - That the exact finding count for this shape still holds at every scale
