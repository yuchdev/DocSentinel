"""Integration tests for DS106 over committed Markdown assets in ``tests/assets/ds106``.

This is Story 04.0 Task 03. Every one of the 14 committed scenarios is loaded in
isolation through the ``asset_case`` fixture and asserted against an explicit,
checked-in expectation table (never against whatever the analyzer currently
emits). Coverage spans the pure ``detect`` entry point, the shared ``scan``
engine, ``select``/``ignore`` (exact and prefix), baseline suppression, the
text/json/github reports, the CLI exit-code mapping for a warning rule,
cross-rule isolation from DS101-DS105/DS109, config propagation through both
``doc_sentinel.toml`` and ``[tool.doc_sentinel]`` for all four DS106 options, and
the linear-time requirement on adversarial (non-fenced, multi-line) input.

Cross-rule overlaps are proven explicitly rather than hidden. DS106 legitimately
coexists with other fast rules on four committed fixtures, so each such sibling
finding is modelled in :data:`EXPECTED_SIBLINGS` and asserted, never suppressed:
``comment_only_section`` carries a real multi-line HTML comment owned by DS102;
``html_tag_only_section`` names an explicit anchor that shadows its heading slug
(DS104); and the image/link in ``image_only_leaf_section`` / ``inline_link_body_text``
point at absent targets that DS101 rightly reports. On the committed default
fixtures DS105 (heading hierarchy) does not actually fire, so no DS105 sibling is
expected; the DS106/DS105 ownership split is instead asserted directly in a
dedicated test. See ``docs/dev/markdown_dialect.md`` for the supported dialect.

The marker-word tests pin a ruling on a question the written spec left open:
DS106 does NOT treat the words ``TODO``/``TBD``/``FIXME``/``WIP`` as non-content.
Under ``placeholder_content_policy = "ignore"`` only HTML comments and whitespace
are non-content, so a section containing such a word has visible content and is
not flagged; detecting the markers themselves is DS119's territory ("DS119 finds
markers; DS106 checks visible section content regardless of both").
