"""Integration tests for DS110 over committed Markdown assets in ``tests/assets/ds110``.

This is Story 07.0 Task 03. Every one of the 14 committed scenarios is loaded in
isolation through the ``asset_case`` fixture and asserted against an explicit,
checked-in expectation table (never against whatever the analyzer currently
emits). DS110 is an *opt-in* policy, so each scenario is exercised with the
EXACT ``Config`` named in its ``fixture-matrix.csv`` ``setup`` column (recorded
once in :data:`SETUP`); the generic Milestone 0005 catalog only asserts the lone
``setup=default`` scenario, so this file owns the proof for the twelve-plus
non-default rows.

Because the policy is off by default, every FINDING scenario is additionally
re-run under the shipped ``Config()`` default and asserted to yield **zero**
findings (:func:`test_default_config_turns_the_policy_off_for_every_finding`).
That proves the rule is genuinely gated off rather than masquerading as an
evaluated clean result. DS110 carries ``opt_in_option="require_fence_languages"``,
so under the default config the engine excludes it from the evaluated-rule count
and names it in ``ScanResult.notice`` as an opt-in rule that is not enabled
(``enabled_rules`` still lists it, by the ratified contract, because selection is
orthogonal to whether an opt-in policy fires). Enabling ``require_fence_languages``
removes the note and restores DS110 to the evaluated count.

Coverage spans the pure ``detect``/``check_text`` entry points, the shared
``scan`` engine, ``select``/``ignore`` (exact plus a genuine ``DS11`` prefix that
contains DS110, the ``DS1`` whole-fast-set prefix, and the negative ``DS2``),
baseline suppression, the text/json/github reports, the CLI exit-code mapping for
a warning rule, cross-rule isolation from DS101-DS106/DS109, config propagation
through both ``docsentinel.toml`` and ``[tool.doc_sentinel]`` for all three DS110
options (including a multi-entry allowlist, label case sensitivity, and invalid
values raising :class:`ConfigError`), a hostile-info-string output-injection
regression, and the linear-time requirement on both single-line and multi-line
adversarial fence floods.

Cross-rule overlaps are proven explicitly rather than hidden. ``DS110`` owns only
fence *metadata*: the unclosed fence in ``malformed_fence_not_repeated`` belongs
to ``DS109`` alone (asserted in :func:`test_ds109_and_ds110_ownership_split`), and
the empty demonstration fences in ``empty_fence_exemption`` /
``empty_fence_strict_policy`` leave their enclosing H1 section visibly empty, which
``DS106`` rightly reports at line 1. Those legitimate siblings are modelled in
:data:`EXPECTED_SIBLINGS` and asserted, never suppressed. See
``docs/dev/markdown_dialect.md`` for the supported ``gfm-subset`` dialect.
