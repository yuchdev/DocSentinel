"""Integration tests for DS115 over committed Markdown assets in ``tests/assets/ds115``.

This is Story 13.0 Task 03, the security-sensitive, opt-in deprecated-references
rule. Every one of the 14 committed scenarios is loaded in isolation through the
``asset_case`` fixture and asserted against an explicit, checked-in expectation table
(:data:`SETUP`, :data:`CLEAN_CASES`, :data:`FINDING_EXPECTATIONS`, :data:`ERROR_CASES`,
:data:`EXPECTED_SIBLINGS`) transcribed from the Task 02 manifest, the ``fixture-matrix``
DS115 rows and the detector's stable message contract -- never derived from whatever the
analyzer currently emits. The generic Milestone 0005 fixture catalog executes **only**
``unconfigured_mapping_is_inert`` (the lone ``default``-setup scenario); the other 13
outcomes carry a non-default ``setup`` and are proven only by this file. For every
scenario the exact ``Config`` is built from its matrix ``setup`` string and the outcome is
asserted through both ``deprecated_refs.detect`` and the shared ``scan`` engine: one-based
line, offending path, ``warning`` severity and message meaning (old token, suggested new,
and provenance = the configured mapping relative path plus the integer entry index), counts
and ordering for the six FINDING cases; zero findings for the six CLEAN cases (including
``unconfigured_mapping_is_inert``, which keeps DS115 in ``enabled_rules`` yet is named in
``ScanResult.notice`` as not enabled and excluded from the evaluated count); and a
fail-closed :class:`ConfigError` (CLI exit 2, no report, no absolute path, no raw
``tomllib`` text) for the two ERROR cases.

DS115 is a ``fast``-profile **opt-in** policy rule at ``warning`` severity, gated on
``deprecated_references_file`` exactly as DS110 is gated on ``require_fence_languages`` and
DS112 on ``navigation_indexes``. With no mapping configured it is registered and selectable
yet evaluates nothing and performs zero filesystem access, and the engine notice names it
``DS115 (set deprecated_references_file)`` and excludes it from the evaluated count; once a
mapping is configured it is counted. Coverage follows the standing threat model
(``docs/security/threat-model-ds115-deprecated-references-2026-10-23.md``): the
config-injection surface (R1/R3) is exercised with injected hostile mapping paths (absolute,
``..``, an in-root symlink out, a directory, a glob, a nonexistent path, a runtime FIFO and
an oversized file) under the filesystem recorder from
``tests/mock/test_detectors_deprecated_oracle.py``, proving each raises a bounded
:class:`ConfigError` without hanging, opening or reading outside the root; hostile mapping
content (bad version, unknown keys, wrong types, bad kind, duplicate/conflicting olds, parse
failure, control bytes, over-cap entry counts) propagates the readiness error end to end
through ``scan``; a deprecated link to an existing and to a missing in-root file is flagged
identically with zero target probe (R9); DS115's "explicitly mapped deprecated name" overlaps
DS101's dangling-link job precisely without a third rule double-reporting (contract E); and
the echoed provenance / configured path is bounded and ``repr``-escaped so no control byte or
resolved absolute path reaches a report sink (R6).

The file also exercises ``select``/``ignore`` (exact and the ``DS11``/``DS1``/``DS2``
prefixes); baseline round-trips; text/json/github report stability; the CLI warning and
readiness exit paths; ``docsentinel rules``/``doctor`` surfacing of the opt-in marker; the
four deprecated options through both ``docsentinel.toml`` and ``[tool.doc_sentinel]``
including invalid values; token boundaries, inline-code/comment masking, multi-word
adjacency, NFC equivalence, regex-metacharacter literalness and the archive ``scope``
exemption through the engine; CRLF line fidelity; an invalid-UTF-8 and an unreadable
**document** surfacing rather than a false clean; determinism across repeated scans; the
fast stdlib-only import with no network or content execution; and the linear-time
requirement on adversarial deprecated floods routed through ``detect`` end to end. The
exhaustive algorithmic shape coverage lives in ``tests/unit/test_detectors_deprecated.py``
and the syscall-level containment proofs in ``tests/mock/test_detectors_deprecated_oracle.py``;
this suite proves the committed scenarios and the cross-module behaviour. See
``docs/dev/markdown_dialect.md`` for the inherited shared-scanner false negatives and the
documented normalization/case policy.
