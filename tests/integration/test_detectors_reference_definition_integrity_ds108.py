"""Integration tests for DS108 over committed Markdown assets in ``tests/assets/ds108``.

This is Story 05.0 Task 03. Every one of the 14 committed scenarios is loaded in
isolation through the ``asset_case`` fixture and asserted against an explicit,
checked-in expectation table (:data:`CLEAN_CASES`, :data:`FINDING_EXPECTATIONS`
and :data:`UNUSED_ENABLED_CASE`) that is transcribed from the Task 02 manifest and
the detector's stable message contract, never derived from whatever the analyzer
currently emits. The 13 ``setup=default`` scenarios are asserted through both the
pure ``references.detect`` entry point and the shared ``scan`` engine; the lone
non-default scenario (``unused_definition_enabled``) is asserted separately with an
exact ``unused_reference_definitions=true`` config so the default-off policy is
never forced on the repo-wide self-scan.

DS108 is an always-active ``fast`` rule at ``warning`` severity. It is a pure
reference-*identity* check: it reasons about labels and definitions and never
resolves a target on disk, so no committed finding fixture produces a sibling from
any other fast rule. That isolation (an undefined label is DS108's alone, never a
DS101 dangling link) is asserted directly: DS101's matcher only sees inline
``[text](target)`` links, so a reference-style ``[text][missing]`` yields only
DS108.

Coverage follows the task: all 14 fixtures; the ``duplicate_reference_definitions``
off/warn/error severity ladder; the ``unused_reference_definitions`` opt-in through
an injected Config and a discovered ``doc_sentinel.toml``; select/ignore (exact and
prefix); baseline round-trips; text/json/github report stability; the CLI fast-json
and strict exit paths; ``docsentinel rules``/``doctor`` surfacing; the edge
dimensions (CRLF line fidelity, invalid UTF-8 surfacing, an unreadable file, a
symlinked Markdown file not inventoried, an out-of-root symlink target DS108 never
follows); determinism across repeated scans; the fast stdlib-only import with no
network or content execution; and the linear-time requirement on adversarial
non-fenced bracket floods (single-line and multi-line, with strictly non-repeating
labels so dedup never collapses the count) routed through ``detect`` end to end.

The exhaustive algorithmic shape coverage for ``_scan_uses`` belongs to the unit
layer; this integration suite proves only that real files route through
``check_text`` with exact deterministic counts and no super-linear blow-up over the
file path.
