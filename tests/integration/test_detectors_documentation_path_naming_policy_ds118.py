"""Integration tests for DS118 over committed Markdown assets in ``tests/assets/ds118``.

This is Story 14.0 Task 03, the opt-in documentation file and directory naming-policy
rule. Every one of the 14 committed scenarios is loaded in isolation through the
``asset_case`` fixture and asserted against an explicit, checked-in expectation table
(:data:`SETUP`, :data:`CLEAN_CASES`, :data:`FINDING_EXPECTATIONS`) transcribed from the
Task 02 manifest, the ``fixture-matrix`` DS118 rows and the detector's stable message
contract -- never derived from whatever the analyzer currently emits. The generic
Milestone 0005 fixture catalog executes **only** ``naming_disabled_is_inert`` (the lone
``default``-setup scenario); the other 13 outcomes carry a non-default ``setup`` and are
proven only by this file. For every scenario the exact ``Config`` is built from its matrix
``setup`` string (``documentation_naming=kebab``/``snake``, ``exclude=["vendor"]`` for the
excluded tree, and the ``????-*`` ADR prefix pattern for ``adr-prefix-allow``) and the
outcome is asserted through both ``naming.detect`` and the shared ``scan`` engine:
``line=None`` (the policy is over the path string, not the body), the offending path,
``warning`` severity and message meaning (the offending component, the suggested rename),
counts and ordering, one finding per offending component per document as implemented, for
the six CLEAN and eight FINDING scenarios the matrix fixes (0 ERROR scenarios -- DS118 has
no readiness error surface: it never touches the filesystem).

DS118 is a ``fast``-profile **opt-in** policy rule at ``warning`` severity, gated on
``documentation_naming`` exactly as DS110 is gated on ``require_fence_languages``, DS112
on ``navigation_indexes`` and DS115 on ``deprecated_references_file``. With the style
``off`` (the default) it is registered and selectable yet evaluates nothing, and the
engine notice names it ``DS118 (set documentation_naming)`` and excludes it from the
evaluated count; selecting a style counts it (the inert ``naming_disabled_is_inert``
scenario flips to a counted finding the moment a style is configured). Unlike every other
rule in ``markdown_dialect.md`` DS118 performs **zero filesystem access** of any kind: it
is a pure policy over ``Document.path``. That contract is proven two ways here -- the
syscall-armed proof lives in ``tests/mock/test_detectors_documentation_naming_oracle.py``,
and this suite additionally proves through the shared engine that a ``select=("DS118",)``
scan touches exactly the paths a no-rule scan touches (DS118 adds none) using the
path-recording recorder from ``tests/mock/test_detectors_document_ids_oracle.py``.

The file also exercises ``select``/``ignore`` (exact and the ``DS11``/``DS1``/``DS2``
prefixes); baseline round-trips; text/json/github report stability; the CLI warning and
strict exit paths; ``docsentinel rules``/``doctor`` surfacing of the opt-in marker; the
four naming options through both ``docsentinel.toml`` and ``[tool.doc_sentinel]``
including invalid values; the injected-``Config`` fail-closed defences (invalid style,
pattern count/length bounds); the exemptions (README.md/index.md, allow exact and
full-path, the ``?``/``*`` glob subset with regex metacharacters matched literally); the
``documentation_naming_directories`` scope toggle; suggested-rename determinism and safety
(ASCII, ``café`` -> ``cafe``, camelCase split, the ``document`` fallback); hostile names
(ESC/newline/``::error``/RTL/NUL/very long components) bounded and ``repr``-escaped in
every report format; the documented NFC-vs-NFD path behaviour; determinism across repeated
scans and fresh roots; the fast stdlib-only import with no network or content execution;
and the linear-time requirement on adversarial naming floods (many documents, long
components, deep nesting and a shared offending prefix) routed through ``detect`` end to
end, with a naive list-membership reference proving the shared workload would be quadratic.
The exhaustive algorithmic shape coverage lives in
``tests/unit/test_detectors_documentation_naming.py``; this suite proves the committed
scenarios and the cross-module behaviour. See ``docs/dev/markdown_dialect.md`` (the DS118
section) for the documented case-insensitive-filesystem and NFC policy.

CRLF, invalid UTF-8, unreadable files and very long *lines* are **not applicable** to
DS118: it never reads document content, so content encoding and line structure cannot
affect a path-only policy. :func:`test_content_is_irrelevant_so_crlf_and_utf8_are_not_applicable`
pins that explicitly rather than leaving the N/A dimensions unexercised.

    Scenario:

        Then its measured log-log slope is clearly super-linear - confirming the shared-workload trap the real
