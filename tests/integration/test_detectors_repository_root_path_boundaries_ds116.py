"""Integration tests for DS116 over committed Markdown assets in ``tests/assets/ds116``.

This is Story 11.0 Task 03, the security-sensitive path-boundary rule. Every one
of the 15 committed scenarios is loaded in isolation through the ``asset_case``
fixture and asserted against an explicit, checked-in expectation table
(:data:`CLEAN_CASES`, :data:`FINDING_EXPECTATIONS` and :data:`EXPECTED_SIBLINGS`)
that is transcribed from the Task 02 manifest and the threat model, never derived
from whatever the analyzer currently emits. The 14 ``setup=default`` scenarios are
asserted through both the pure ``detect`` entry point and the shared ``scan``
engine; the lone ``runtime-symlink-companion`` scenario
(``symlink_escape_is_rejected``) commits only its Markdown owner, so this suite
builds the in-root symlink and the sibling out-of-root target at runtime in
``tmp_path`` and proves, with the shared filesystem recorder from
``tests/mock/test_path_boundaries_oracle.py``, that nothing outside the scan root
(including the symlink's real target) is ever stat-ed, opened or listed.

DS116 is an always-active ``fast`` rule at ``error`` severity with no opt-in
marker, so a single finding makes the CLI exit 1 even without ``--strict`` while a
clean tree exits 0; both are asserted. Coverage follows the standing threat-model
checklist: the detector owns every unsafe reference category for links, images,
reference definitions and HTML attributes, while DS101/DS103 keep their in-root
behaviour and never stat an escaping target (the ownership split is asserted
through :data:`EXPECTED_SIBLINGS`). Inline code spans report only genuine traversal
(root escape, residual single-decode encoding, in-root symlink-out); drive, UNC and
backslash code spans are documentation and stay with DS103.

The file also exercises select/ignore (exact plus the live ``DS11`` prefix that
contains DS110/DS112/DS113/DS114/DS115/DS116/DS117 today, the whole-fast-set ``DS1`` prefix and the
negative ``DS2``), baseline round-trips, text/json/github report stability, the
three CLI exit paths, ``docsentinel rules``/``doctor`` surfacing, the engine
notice, config propagation for ``root_escape_policy`` / ``decode_percent_paths`` /
``windows_path_policy`` through both ``docsentinel.toml`` and ``[tool.doc_sentinel]``
(invalid values raising :class:`ConfigError`), hostile-target output safety
(bounded, repr-escaped echo; exactly one ``::error`` line per finding), and the
edge dimensions required by the task (CRLF lines, invalid UTF-8, unreadable file,
symlinked Markdown not inventoried, very long lines, repeated/fresh roots, fast
stdlib-only import, no network or content execution, documents passed individually,
a subdirectory scan root as the boundary, and cwd never entering resolution). The
small integration-level routing and bounded symlink-chain checks confirm linear
handling; the exhaustive algorithmic floods live in
``tests/unit/test_detectors_path_boundaries_adversarial.py`` and are not duplicated.
