"""Integration tests for DS109 over committed Markdown assets in ``tests/assets/ds109``.

This is Story 06.0 Task 03. Every one of the 14 committed scenarios is loaded in
isolation through the ``asset_case`` fixture and asserted against an explicit,
checked-in expectation table (never against whatever the analyzer currently
emits). Coverage spans the pure ``detect`` entry point, the shared ``scan``
engine, ``select``/``ignore``, baseline suppression, the text/json/github
reports, the CLI, cross-rule isolation from DS101-DS103, and the linear-time
requirement on adversarial fenced input.

The supported dialect is the ``gfm-subset`` documented in
``docs/dev/markdown_dialect.md``; these tests exercise its known boundaries
(indent <= 3 openers, matching-marker closers, closer length >= opener length,
backtick-opener info-string rule, CRLF line fidelity) rather than full
CommonMark/GFM conformance.
