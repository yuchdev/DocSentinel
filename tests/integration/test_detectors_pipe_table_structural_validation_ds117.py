"""Integration tests for DS117 over committed Markdown assets in ``tests/assets/ds117``.

This is Story 08.0 Task 03. Every one of the 15 committed scenarios is loaded in
isolation through the ``asset_case`` fixture and asserted against an explicit,
checked-in expectation table (never against whatever the analyzer currently
emits). Coverage spans the pure ``detect`` entry point, the shared ``scan``
engine, ``select``/``ignore`` (exact and prefix), baseline suppression, the
text/json/github reports, the CLI exit-code mapping for a warning rule,
cross-rule isolation from the rest of the fast profile, config propagation
through both ``doc_sentinel.toml`` and ``[tool.doc_sentinel]`` for the three
DS117 options (``table_enable``, ``table_strict_cells``, ``table_dialect``), the
output-injection safety of its messages, and the linear-time requirement on
adversarial single-line and multi-line pipe floods.

Cross-rule ownership is proven explicitly rather than hidden. On the committed
default fixtures no sibling fast rule fires, so :data:`EXPECTED_SIBLINGS` is
empty and asserted to stay empty under a full fast scan; the two interesting
splits are asserted directly instead. A table is section content, so a
table-only section never triggers DS106; and an invalid-looking table inside a
code fence is DS109/DS110 territory, so DS117 stays silent there.

Two deliberate boundary facts are pinned. The committed ``invalid_alignment_marker``
fixture uses ``-:-`` (a misplaced colon) rather than the ``:--:`` the fixture
matrix text names, because ``:--:`` is in fact valid GFM centre alignment inside
this supported subset; this recorded deviation is pinned by a table of
delimiter-cell variants. And a pipe inside an inline code span does **not** split
a cell in DS117, unlike GitHub's own table parser -- a documented limitation in
``docs/dev/markdown_dialect.md`` pinned by an explanatory test below.
