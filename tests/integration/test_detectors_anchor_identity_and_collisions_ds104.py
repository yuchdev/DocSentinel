"""Integration tests for DS104 over committed Markdown assets in ``tests/assets/ds104``.

This is Story 02.0 Task 03. Every one of the 14 committed scenarios is loaded in
isolation through the ``asset_case`` fixture and asserted against an explicit,
checked-in expectation table (never against whatever the analyzer currently
emits). Coverage spans the pure ``detect`` entry point, the shared ``scan``
engine, ``select``/``ignore`` (exact and prefix), baseline suppression, the
text/json/github reports, the CLI exit-code mapping for a warning rule,
cross-rule isolation from DS101-DS103/DS105/DS109, config propagation through
both ``doc_sentinel.toml`` and ``[tool.doc_sentinel]`` (the ``anchor_collision_policy``
and ``anchor_renderer`` options, policy ``off`` disabling the rule, and invalid
values raising :class:`ConfigError`), and the linear-time requirement on
adversarial (non-fenced) anchor and heading input.

Two cross-rule ownership facts are proven explicitly rather than hidden. The
``anchor_inside_html_comment`` fixture carries a real multi-line HTML comment
that its rightful owner DS102 reports, so that one sibling finding is modelled in
:data:`EXPECTED_SIBLINGS` instead of being suppressed. And the DS101/DS104 split
is asserted directly: DS104 never reports a dangling link, DS101 never reports a
duplicate explicit id.

The supported dialect is the ``gfm-subset`` documented in
``docs/dev/markdown_dialect.md``; these tests exercise its explicit-anchor
identity boundaries (``<a id=...>`` / ``<a name=...>`` tokens, GitHub-style slug
collisions with duplicate-suffixed headings, case sensitivity, fenced/commented/
inline-code exclusion, cross-document scoping, CRLF line fidelity) rather than
full CommonMark/GFM conformance.
