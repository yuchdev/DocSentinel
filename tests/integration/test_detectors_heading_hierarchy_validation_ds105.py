"""Integration tests for DS105 over committed Markdown assets in ``tests/assets/ds105``.

This is Story 03.0 Task 03. Every one of the 14 committed scenarios is loaded in
isolation through the ``asset_case`` fixture and asserted against an explicit,
checked-in expectation table (never against whatever the analyzer currently
emits). Coverage spans the pure ``detect`` entry point, the shared ``scan``
engine, ``select``/``ignore``, baseline suppression, the text/json/github
reports, the CLI exit-code mapping for a warning rule, cross-rule isolation from
DS101-DS103/DS109, config propagation through both ``doc_sentinel.toml`` and
``[tool.doc_sentinel]``, and the linear-time requirement on adversarial
(non-fenced) heading input.

Two scenarios are deliberately *not* default-setup and the shared Milestone 0005
catalog only exercises default scenarios, so this file owns them: it builds the
exact :class:`Config` each requires (``multiple_h1_policy='warn'`` for
``optional_multiple_h1_warning``; ``first_heading_level=2`` for
``optional_nonroot_start``) and proves the complementary default-config outcome
the Task 02 spec promises.

The supported dialect is the ``gfm-subset`` documented in
``docs/dev/markdown_dialect.md``; these tests exercise its heading boundaries
(ATX + setext tokens, fenced/commented/frontmatter exclusion, blockquote and
inline hashes being non-headings, CRLF line fidelity) rather than full
CommonMark/GFM conformance.
