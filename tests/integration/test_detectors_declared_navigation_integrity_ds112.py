"""Integration tests for DS112 over committed Markdown assets in ``tests/assets/ds112``.

This is Story 09.0 Task 03, the security-sensitive, opt-in configured-navigation
rule. Every one of the 14 committed scenarios is loaded in isolation through the
``asset_case`` fixture and asserted against an explicit, checked-in expectation
table (:data:`SETUP`, :data:`CLEAN_CASES`, :data:`FINDING_EXPECTATIONS`,
:data:`ERROR_CASE`, :data:`EXPECTED_SIBLINGS`) transcribed from the Task 02 manifest,
the ``fixture-matrix`` DS112 rows and the detector's stable message contract, never
derived from whatever the analyzer currently emits. The generic Milestone 0005
fixture catalog executes **none** of the 14 DS112 scenarios -- all carry a non-default
``setup`` -- so this file is the only place their outcomes are proven. For every
scenario the exact ``Config`` is built from its matrix ``setup`` string and the
outcome is asserted through both ``navigation.detect`` and the shared ``scan`` engine:
one-based line, offending path, ``warning`` severity and message meaning for the five
FINDING cases, zero findings for the eight CLEAN cases, and a fail-closed
:class:`ConfigError` (CLI exit 2, no report, no absolute path) for the lone ERROR case.

DS112 is a ``fast``-profile **opt-in** policy rule at ``warning`` severity, gated on
``navigation_indexes`` exactly as DS110 is gated on ``require_fence_languages``. With
no index configured it is registered and selectable yet evaluates nothing, and the
engine notice names it ``DS112 (set navigation_indexes)`` and excludes it from the
evaluated count; once an index is configured it is counted. Coverage follows the
standing threat model
(``docs/security/threat-model-ds112-navigation-integrity-2026-10-23.md``): the
config-injection surface is exercised with injected hostile indexes (absolute, ``..``,
an in-root symlink out, a directory, a glob, a non-Markdown file, a nonexistent path,
a runtime FIFO and a huge file) under the filesystem recorder from
``tests/mock/test_detectors_navigation_oracle.py``, proving each raises a
:class:`ConfigError` (or is bounded-read) without hanging, opening or reading outside
the root; the escaping nav target is DS112's lexical finding and DS116's ``error``
finding with no double stat; a missing nav destination is the documented DS101 + DS112
overlap; a prose link outside any list and a nav-looking link inside a fence are not
navigation; reference-style items are joined to their definitions; and the echoed
target/index path is bounded and ``repr``-escaped so no control byte or resolved
absolute path reaches a report sink.

The file also exercises ``select``/``ignore`` (exact and the ``DS11``/``DS1``/``DS2``
prefixes); baseline round-trips; text/json/github report stability; the CLI warning
exit paths; ``docsentinel rules``/``doctor`` surfacing of the opt-in marker; the four
navigation options through both ``docsentinel.toml`` and ``[tool.doc_sentinel]``
including invalid values; CRLF line fidelity; invalid UTF-8 and an unreadable index
surfacing rather than a false clean; determinism across repeated scans; the fast
stdlib-only import with no network or content execution; and the linear-time
requirement on adversarial navigation floods (single-line, multi-line and a large
``navigation_required`` set) routed through ``detect`` end to end. The exhaustive
algorithmic shape coverage lives in ``tests/unit/test_detectors_navigation.py`` and the
syscall-level containment proofs in ``tests/mock/test_detectors_navigation_oracle.py``;
this suite proves the committed scenarios and the cross-module behaviour. See
``docs/dev/markdown_dialect.md`` for the inherited shared-scanner and list-membership
gaps (indented/block-quoted list items and shortcut references are known false
negatives).
