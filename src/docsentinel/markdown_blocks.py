"""Shared, standard-library-only Markdown block scanner.

This module provides a single, reusable tokenizer for the narrow GFM subset
that DocSentinel's fast detectors depend on. It exists so that multiple fast
checks do not reimplement incompatible fence, heading, and inline masking.

The scanner is deterministic, runs in time proportional to the source length
for ordinary input, and performs no file, network, or subprocess I/O. It uses
only the Python standard library, regardless of which optional extras are
installed, so importing it never pulls in ``standard`` or ``deep`` dependencies.

Offsets reported by every token are **character** offsets (Python ``str``
indices) into the input text exactly as supplied, expressed as half-open
ranges ``[start_offset, end_offset)``. Line numbers are **one-based** physical
line numbers counting ``\\n``, ``\\r\\n``, and ``\\r`` terminators; a missing
final newline does not create a phantom trailing line.

See ``docs/dev/markdown_dialect.md`` for the supported dialect and the
intentional gaps (this module does not claim CommonMark or full GFM
conformance).
