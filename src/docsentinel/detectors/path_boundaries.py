"""Detect documentation references that escape the scan root (``DS116``).

This fast, standard-library-only analyzer reports references whose target leaves
the configured documentation root: lexical parent-directory escapes, percent-
encoded escapes, Windows drive/UNC/backslash paths, control bytes, and in-root
symlinks whose target points outside the root. It is a deterministic structural
check that reuses the shared, purely lexical resolver
:func:`docsentinel.markdown_blocks.resolve_local_reference` and the shared
Markdown scanner; it never adds a second path resolver.

Security contract (see ``docs/security/threat-model-ds116-path-boundaries-2026-10-22.md``):

* **No filesystem access outside the root.** A target is only touched on the
  filesystem once it is lexically confirmed inside the root. Lexical escapes and
  unsafe ``UNSUPPORTED`` targets are classified with zero filesystem calls.
* **Decode exactly once.** Percent-encoding is decoded a single time by the
  shared resolver and the remainder is treated literally, so ``%252e%252e`` stays
  in-root rather than double-decoding to ``..``. When ``decode_percent_paths`` is
  false the analyzer suppresses that single decode (by neutralising ``%`` before
  the resolver's own ``unquote``) yet still catches raw ``../`` traversal.
* **Residual-encoding defence (ruling G1).** After the single decode, a path
  component that still carries a percent-encoded dot or separator octet
  (``%2e``/``%2f``/``%5c``, any case) is reported; a lone ``%25`` such as
  ``100%25.md`` and other residual ``%xx`` stay clean. The analyzer never decodes
  twice.
* **Safe, non-following symlink containment (ruling G4).** Lexical containment is
  checked first; only for a lexically in-root target does the analyzer walk the
  normalised components with :func:`os.lstat`/:func:`os.readlink` on the in-root
  symlink objects, computing each symlink's target lexically. A symlink whose
  target escapes the root is a finding. No path outside the root is ever
  ``stat``-ed, opened, ``realpath``-ed, or ``resolve``-ed, and the walk is bounded
  (hop limit plus per-component loop detection) so it stays linear.
* **Bounded, repr-escaped echo.** A finding message echoes only the author's raw
  target, bounded to :data:`_MAX_ECHO` characters and repr-escaped so no control
  byte, ``ESC`` sequence, or non-ASCII byte reaches the report sinks; the resolved
  absolute path, the target's existence, and its file type are never disclosed.

Ruling G3 is honoured by the shared resolver: an absolute POSIX path such as
``/etc/passwd`` is reinterpreted root-relative (clean), consistent with the
root-relative ``/docs/guide.md`` allowance. The current working directory never
enters resolution; the trusted scan root is canonicalised exactly once in
:func:`detect`.

``DS116`` is an always-active ``fast``-profile rule: it registers its
:class:`~docsentinel.rules.Rule` and ``ANALYZERS`` entry as an import side effect
(Story 11.0 Task 02, together with the committed ``tests/assets/ds116/*``
fixtures the Milestone 0005 catalog is registration gated on). It registers
**without** an ``opt_in_option`` -- unlike the opt-in ``DS110``, ``DS116`` is on
by default at ``error`` severity.

The ownership split differs by reference kind (Story 11.0 code-span ruling):

* **Links, images, reference definitions, and HTML ``href``/``src``/``srcset``**
  are checked at full strictness: every unsafe category is a DS116 finding, and
  ``DS101`` delegates all of them to DS116 via :func:`is_ds116_owned` rather than
  resolving or ``stat``-ing an escaped link target.
* **Inline code spans** are documentation, not references, so DS116 reports only
  genuine traversal there -- a lexical root escape (including percent-encoded and
  residual-encoding forms) or an in-root symlink pointing outside. Drive, UNC,
  rooted-backslash, embedded-backslash, and control-looking code spans (and regex
  or escape spans such as ``\\n`` or ``DS\\d{3}``) are **not** DS116 findings; DS103
  resumes its exact pre-Story-11 behaviour for them and only skips the root-escape
  and symlink-out code spans that DS116 owns.

The shared scanner feeds DS116 the reference forms a CommonMark renderer makes
live, so the Story 11.0 close-gate sweep closed several evasions: HTML ``<a href>``
and ``<img>``/``<source>`` ``srcset`` attributes are extracted; a ``<...>``
angle-bracket destination is unwrapped; HTML entity and numeric character
references in a destination are decoded once (via the shared resolver); a nested
image-in-link-text exposes the **outer** destination; and a reference definition
inside a block quote is recognised.

**DS116 is not a complete containment control; it is a deterministic,
best-effort structural guard.** Known false negatives remain, pinned by tests and
documented in ``docs/dev/markdown_dialect.md``:

* **Multi-line references.** The shared scanner is line-based, so a link or
  reference definition whose destination is split across physical lines is not
  joined and escapes detection.
* **Nested-parenthesis destinations.** The destination ends at the first ``)``, so
  a CommonMark balanced-parenthesis destination such as ``x(y)z.md`` is truncated
  (a parsing approximation, not a guaranteed catch).
* **Time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU).** The downstream existence checks in DS101
  and DS103 run after DS116's lexical gate; a symlink swapped between the gate and
  the check is a theoretical race. DS116 itself never opens or reads target
  content, so it has no exploitable use window; the residual race is acknowledged
  and not fixed here (there is no cheap, deterministic fix without a single
  atomic open DocSentinel deliberately avoids).
