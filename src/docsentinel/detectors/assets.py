"""Detect missing local media and document assets (``DS113``).

This fast, standard-library-only analyzer reports local **asset** references whose
target does not exist, is not a regular file, or cannot be used as an asset,
**inside the scan root only**. It resolves Markdown images (``![alt](target)``),
HTML ``<img src>``/``<source src>`` tags and ``<source srcset>``/``<img srcset>``
candidates, HTML ``<a href>`` link targets, and reference-style image/link
definitions to local paths, then checks existence and regular-file status with
``os.stat``/``stat.S_ISREG`` -- it **never opens or reads asset content**.

It reuses the shared, purely lexical resolver
:func:`docsentinel.markdown_blocks.resolve_local_reference` and the shared Markdown
scanner; it adds no second path resolver and runs no regex over unmasked source.

Security contract (see
``docs/security/threat-model-ds113-missing-assets-2026-10-23.md`` and the DS116
precedent). The DS116 standing requirements apply as a floor and are not relaxed:

* **No filesystem access outside the root (R2).** Before any filesystem call a
  target is routed through :func:`~docsentinel.detectors.path_boundaries.is_ds116_owned`
  and the shared resolver; the analyzer acts **only** on a ``RESOLVED`` in-root
  candidate, and then only when
  :func:`~docsentinel.detectors.path_boundaries.escapes_via_symlink` is false on it.
  ``EXTERNAL`` targets (URL schemes, protocol-relative ``//host``, ``data:`` URIs),
  safe ``UNSUPPORTED`` targets (``template``, ``glob``), fragment-only targets, and
  every DS116-owned unsafe category (``OUTSIDE_ROOT``, ``drive``, ``unc``,
  ``backslash``, ``control``) or in-root-symlink-out candidate are skipped with
  **no** ``stat``. An escaped or symlink-out missing asset is DS116's finding, never
  DS113's.
* **Never open or read content (special-files, R3).** Existence and file type are
  decided with ``os.stat`` + :func:`stat.S_ISREG` only -- never ``open``, ``read``,
  ``imghdr``, or any content sniff. A committed FIFO, device, socket, or directory
  at an asset path is reported as a non-regular-file finding **without** being
  opened, so it can neither block the scan nor read unbounded data. An in-root
  symlink whose (lexically in-root) target is a regular file is a **valid** asset;
  a symlink whose target escapes the root is DS116's, not a DS113 "missing" finding.
* **``srcset`` / ``data:`` URI splitting (fixed).** The shared
  :func:`docsentinel.markdown_blocks._srcset_urls` now collects each candidate URL as
  a whitespace-delimited run, so a ``data:`` URI's internal comma can never
  manufacture a spurious in-root filesystem probe.
* **Bounded, repr-escaped echo.** A finding message echoes only the author's raw
  target, bounded to :data:`_MAX_ECHO` characters and ``unicode_escape``-escaped so
  no control byte, ``ESC`` sequence, or non-ASCII byte reaches the report sinks; the
  resolved absolute path and the specific non-regular file *type* are never
  disclosed (only "missing" / "not a regular file").
* **Linear cost.** Resolution and classification reuse the shared scanner and are
  O(total bytes); at most **one** ``stat`` is performed per distinct resolved
  in-root path (memoised within a document), duplicate ``(line, message)`` findings
  are collapsed, and the containment gate runs before any ``stat`` so escaped floods
  cost no I/O.

Rulings recorded (threat model R1-R5):

* **R1** -- a reference *definition's* target is checked only when its decoded
  extension is in ``asset_extensions`` **and** the definition is actually used
  (its normalized label appears among the reference uses), so DS113 neither steps
  on DS101's link territory nor flags an unused definition (DS108's concern).
* **R2** -- DS116-owned and escaped references are never ``stat``-ed (above).
* **R3** -- an in-root symlink to an in-root regular file is valid; an existing
  non-regular in-root path (directory, FIFO, device, socket) is a finding reported
  without opening it.
* **R4** -- the shared scanner does not model backslash escapes outside table
  cells, so ``\\![alt](x.png)`` is still seen as an image (a possible over-detection,
  never a hidden escape). This is accepted rather than diverging from the scanner.
* **R5** -- Markdown ``![]()`` and HTML ``<img>``/``<source>`` images are checked
  **regardless** of extension (an image is an asset by syntax); ``asset_extensions``
  (matched case-insensitively) gates only link-shaped references (HTML ``<a href>``
  and reference definitions), so DS113 does not probe every ordinary ``.md`` link.

**DS113 is a best-effort structural guard, not a complete asset-integrity or
containment control.** It inherits every shared-scanner false negative (multi-line
or nested-parenthesis destinations, multi-line HTML tags, unquoted attributes;
see ``docs/dev/markdown_dialect.md``). Existence is decided by the host
filesystem's case policy, so a case-mismatched reference such as ``Logo.PNG`` to a
committed ``logo.png`` is **platform-dependent** (present on case-insensitive macOS
or Windows, missing on a case-sensitive Linux CI runner); DS113 does not add a
per-directory case check. A residual symlink-swap TOCTOU exists exactly as in
DS101/DS103: the non-following :func:`escapes_via_symlink` gate runs before the
following ``os.stat``; DS113 never opens content, so it has no exploitable use
window of its own.

``DS113`` is **registered** by this module (Story 10.0 Task 02) as an always-active,
default-on fast rule at ``error`` severity: it calls ``register_rule`` on its
:class:`~docsentinel.rules.Rule` and wires :func:`detect` into ``ANALYZERS``, so the
Milestone 0005 fixture catalog now enforces every committed ``tests/assets/ds113/*``
scenario.
