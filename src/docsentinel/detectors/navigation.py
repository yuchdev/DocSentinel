"""Detect declared documentation navigation integrity problems (``DS112``).

This fast, standard-library-only analyzer reports contract violations inside a
small set of **user-configured navigation index** Markdown documents. When
``navigation_indexes`` names one or more indexes, ``DS112`` extracts the local
links that constitute declared navigation (the links on *navigation list items*)
and reports three things, all **inside the scan root only**:

* a ``navigation_required`` document that no navigation link points at;
* a navigation target linked more than once (``navigation_unique_targets``); and
* a navigation link whose local destination does not exist
  (``navigation_check_missing``).

A missing, unreadable, non-regular, out-of-root, or non-discovered configured
index is a **config/readiness error** (:class:`~docsentinel.config.ConfigError`),
never a silent clean result and never a :class:`~docsentinel.models.Finding`.

**"Appear exactly once" is two orthogonal checks, not one.** Story 09.0's README
summarises the contract as "required targets appear exactly once ... and duplicates
are reported once each at the later link". ``DS112`` realises that phrasing as the
*union* of two independent sub-checks rather than a single coupled rule, which is
the shape the config options and the Task 02 fixtures require:

* **presence** -- ``navigation_required`` reports a required document that no
  navigation link points at (``missing_required_nav_item``); it does not care how
  many times a listed target appears; and
* **uniqueness** -- ``navigation_unique_targets`` (default **on**) reports a
  navigation target linked more than once, once at the *later* link
  (``duplicate_navigation_target``, ``duplicate_with_fragments``).

Because ``navigation_unique_targets`` defaults on, a required target listed twice is
still reported once (as a duplicate), so the observable "exactly once" behaviour
holds under the shipped defaults; the two concerns stay separately toggleable. No
fixture requires a required target to be flagged *specifically for being required
and duplicated*, so the decomposition satisfies the matrix with no coupled
"required-appears-twice" check.

It reuses the shared, purely lexical resolver
:func:`docsentinel.markdown_blocks.resolve_local_reference` and the shared Markdown
scanner; it adds no second path resolver and runs no regex over unmasked source.

Security contract (see
``docs/security/threat-model-ds112-navigation-integrity-2026-10-23.md`` and the
DS116/DS113 precedents). Unlike DS113/DS116, ``DS112`` is driven by
**attacker-controlled configuration** as well as content: in CI/pre-commit a PR
author chooses which files ``navigation_indexes`` opens. The DS116/DS113 floor
applies unchanged and the following DS112-specific controls are added:

* **Config-injection containment (R2).** An index is opened **only** when it is a
  member of the engine-supplied ``documents`` (discovery has already proven it is
  an in-root, non-symlink, regular, include-matched ``.md`` file). Because an
  injected :class:`~docsentinel.config.Config` bypasses ``load_config``
  validation, the open is also defended lexically with
  :func:`~docsentinel.detectors.path_boundaries.is_ds116_owned`, by resolver
  containment, by :func:`~docsentinel.detectors.path_boundaries.escapes_via_symlink`,
  and by ``os.stat`` + :func:`stat.S_ISREG`; the read is bounded to
  :data:`_MAX_INDEX_BYTES`. A FIFO/device/socket/directory/symlink-out/outside/
  non-``.md`` configured index is never opened.
* **No filesystem access outside the root (R4/R6).** Every navigation target is
  routed through :func:`resolve_local_reference` and
  :func:`~docsentinel.detectors.path_boundaries.is_ds116_owned` first. A target
  that escapes lexically (``OUTSIDE_ROOT`` / DS116-owned) is reported **purely
  lexically with zero filesystem access** as an escape finding (R4; an intentional
  overlap with DS116, which reports it at ``error``). The missing-destination
  probe (R6) is ``os.stat`` only (never ``open``), run only on a ``RESOLVED``,
  in-root, non-``is_ds116_owned``, non-symlink-escaping target, one ``stat`` per
  distinct resolved path (memoised).
* **Fail-closed readiness error (R3).** A missing/unreadable/non-regular/out-of-root
  /non-discovered configured index raises :class:`~docsentinel.config.ConfigError`,
  which the engine propagates to CLI exit ``2`` (``Scan failed: ...``) and to a
  raised exception for the Python API / pytest. It is never a warning-severity
  finding and never a silent skip; no new exit code and no JSON schema v1 change.
* **Bounded, repr-escaped echo.** Every finding message and every readiness
  ``ConfigError`` echo only the author's raw target or the configured index path,
  bounded to :data:`_MAX_ECHO` characters and ``unicode_escape``-escaped, so no
  control byte, ``ESC`` sequence, or non-ASCII byte reaches the report sinks or
  the ``Scan failed:`` line; the resolved absolute path is never echoed.
* **Linear cost.** Navigation targets are resolved once per link (O(links)); the
  ``navigation_required`` check is set membership over the union of resolved
  targets (O(links + required), never O(required x links)); duplicate detection is
  a per-index set; the list-marker scan is a single bounded linear pass over the
  masked text with no catastrophic regex; the index read is bounded; and the
  missing-destination ``stat`` is memoised.

Rulings recorded (threat model R1-R8):

* **R1 -- navigation scope.** The shared scanner does not model lists, so ``DS112``
  derives navigation-list membership itself, line-by-line **over the scanner's
  masked text** (fenced code, inline code, and HTML comments blanked), with a
  bounded linear marker test (``-``/``*``/``+`` or ordered ``N.``/``N)`` with 0-3
  spaces of indentation), exactly as DS108 derives its reference view and DS117 its
  table rows over masked text. Only inline links and full/collapsed reference uses
  whose start line is a navigation list item are navigation; prose links outside
  lists and links inside fenced/inline-code/comment regions are not. No regex over
  unmasked source.
* **R2 -- index read discipline and membership** (above). A configured index that
  exists but is excluded by ``include``/``exclude`` is absent from ``documents`` and
  is therefore the R3 readiness error (an internally inconsistent configuration),
  not a silent skip.
* **R3 -- readiness error surface** (above).
* **R4 -- escaping nav target** (above): a DS112 finding emitted lexically, with
  the documented intentional DS116 overlap.
* **R5 -- target identity / normalization.** Navigation links and
  ``navigation_required`` entries are compared as canonical **root-anchored,
  fragment-stripped** paths produced by :func:`resolve_local_reference` (reusing its
  single entity+percent decode and ``<...>`` unwrap). Navigation links resolve
  relative to the **index location**, not the process cwd; duplicate identity
  ignores the fragment. String comparison is exact (case-sensitive); the existence
  probe's case behaviour is the host filesystem's and is documented.
* **R6 -- missing-destination discipline** (above). This overlaps DS101's
  dangling-link check by design; ``DS112`` does not depend on DS107 and does its own
  normalized resolution.
* **R7 -- reference-style vs shortcut nav items.** Full ``[text][label]`` and
  collapsed ``[label][]`` navigation items are resolved by joining
  ``reference_uses`` to ``reference_definitions`` by normalized label. **Shortcut**
  ``[label]`` navigation items are a documented shared-scanner gap (the scanner does
  not populate ``reference_uses`` for shortcuts) and are an accepted ``DS112`` false
  negative, not patched with an ad-hoc regex.
* **R8 -- opt-in accounting.** The opt-in gate is ``navigation_indexes`` only;
  ``navigation_check_missing``/``navigation_unique_targets``/``navigation_required``
  are sub-options, not part of the gate, so ``DS112`` is genuinely evaluated whenever
  indexes are configured even if the sub-checks are off. Empty ``navigation_indexes``
  makes ``DS112`` not-applicable and it is named (not counted) in the engine notice,
  mirroring DS110.

**DS112 is a best-effort structural guard, not a complete navigation-integrity
control.** It inherits every shared-scanner false negative (multi-line and
nested-parenthesis destinations, multi-line HTML tags, unquoted attributes,
shortcut references; see ``docs/dev/markdown_dialect.md``) plus the self-derived
list-membership heuristic (list items indented beyond three spaces, and list items
nested inside block quotes or indented code, are not recognised) and the
platform-dependent case behaviour of the existence probe.

``DS112`` is registered as an import side effect of this module (Story 09.0
Task 02): the :class:`~docsentinel.rules.Rule` is passed through ``register_rule``
and :func:`detect` is wired into ``ANALYZERS`` at the end of the module, exactly as
DS108/DS110/DS113 were sequenced, so the Milestone 0005 fixture catalog enforces
every committed ``tests/assets/ds112/*`` scenario. Because the opt-in gate is
``navigation_indexes`` (empty by default), the rule is inert on an unconfigured
repo and is honestly reported as not-applicable in the engine notice.

    strings; :func:`detect` layers the engine-supplied document membership, the
    readiness error, and the cross-index ``navigation_required`` aggregation over it.
    It reports the escape (R4), duplicate (``navigation_unique_targets``), and
    missing-destination (``navigation_check_missing``, R6) violations found within
    this single index; the ``navigation_required`` contract spans every configured
    index and so belongs to :func:`detect`.

    :param text: The index document's Markdown text exactly as read.
    :param index_path: POSIX-style relative path recorded on each finding and used as
        the resolver base (navigation links resolve relative to the index location).
